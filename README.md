<div class = "text">
    Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, MON ( /ˌfʊnmiˈlaɪjoʊ ˈrænsəm ˈkuːti/; born Frances Abigail Olufunmilayo Thomas; 25 October 
    1900 – 13 April 1978), also known as Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, was a Nigerian educator, political campaigner, suffragist, 
    and women's rights activist.
    Born in Abeokuta, Nigeria, Ransome-Kuti was the first female student to attend the Abeokuta Grammar School. 
    As a young adult, she worked as a teacher, organizing some of the first preschool classes in the country and 
    arranging literacy classes for lower-income women.
    During the 1940s, Ransome-Kuti established the Abeokuta Women’s Union and fought for women’s rights, demanding better 
    representation of women in local governing bodies and an end to unfair taxes on market women. Described by media as the 
    "Lioness of Lisabi",[1]:77 she led marches and protests of up to 10,000 women, forcing the ruling Alake to temporarily abdicate in 1949.
    As Ransome-Kuti’s political influence grew, she took part in the Nigerian independence movement, attending conferences and joining 
    overseas delegations to discuss proposed national constitutions. Spearheading the creation of the Nigerian Women’s Union and the 
    Federation of Nigerian Women’s Societies, she advocated for Nigerian women’s right to vote and became a noted member of international 
    peace and women's rights movements.
    Ransome-Kuti received the Lenin Peace Prize and was awarded membership in the Order of the Niger for her work. In her later years, 
    she supported her sons' criticisms of Nigeria's military governments. She died aged 77 after receiving injuries from a military raid on 
    family property. Ransome-Kuti's children included the musician Fela Kuti, doctor and activist Beko Ransome-Kuti, and health minister 
    Olikoye Ransome-Kuti.

    <h2 class="early">EARLY LIFE</h2>

<div class="text2">Frances Abigail Olufunmilayo Thomas was born on 25 October 1900 in Abeokuta, Nigeria,[2] 
    to Chief Daniel Olumeyuwa Thomas (1869–1954), 
    a member of the aristocratic Jibolu-Taiwo family, and Lucretia Phyllis Omoyeni Adeosolu (1874–1956).[1]:20 Her father farmed and traded 
    palm produce, and her mother worked as a dressmaker.[3] On her father's side, Frances was descended from Sarah Taiwo, a Yoruba woman who 
    had been captured by slave traders in the early 19th century before eventually returning home to her family in Abeokuta.[1]:19–23
    Although it was uncommon at the time for Nigerian families to invest in much education for girls, Frances's parents believed in 
    the importance of education for both boys and girls.[1]:28 She attended Abeokuta Grammar School for her secondary education.[4] 
    The school had initially been open only to male students, but it admitted its first female students in 1914, and Frances was first 
    among the six girls registered for study that year.[1]:28–29 From 1919 to 1922, she went abroad and attended a finishing school for 
    girls in Cheshire, England, where she learned elocution, music, dressmaking, French, and various domestic skills. It was there that 
    she made the permanent decision to use her shortened Yoruba name, Funmilayo, instead of her Christian name Frances,[1]:30–31 likely in 
    response to personal experiences of racism in England.[5] Afterwards, she returned to Abeokuta and worked as a teacher.[2]
    On 20 January 1925, Funmilayo married Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, a member of the Ransome-Kuti family.[1]:33 
    Israel had studied at the Abeokuta Grammar School several years ahead of Funmilayo, and while she was still in school the two 
    had developed a friendship followed by a courtship.[1]:29 Israel found work as a school principal, and he strongly believed in 
    bringing people together and overcoming ethnic and regional divisions. He later became a co-founder of both the Nigeria Union of Teachers 
    and of the Nigerian Union of Students.[1]:46–47 His marriage with Funmilayo would last 30 years – until Israel's death – and was marked by 
    a sense of equality and deep mutual respect between the couple.[1]:42
    After marriage, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti had quit her old job as a teacher, but she soon found other projects. In 1928 she established one of 
    the first preschool classes in Nigeria. Around the same time, she started a club for young women of elite families to encourage their 
    "self-improvement", while also organizing classes for illiterate women.[1]:38 Between 1935 and 1936, the couple arranged to purchase a 
    secondhand car and had it shipped to them from England. Ransome-Kuti was the first woman in Abeokuta to drive a car.[1]:48
    Ransome-Kuti and her husband had four children: a daughter named Dolupo (1926) and sons Olikoye (1927), Olufela "Fela" (1938), 
    and Bekolari "Beko" (1940).[1]:47 & 49 </div>

    <h2 class="activism">ACTIVISM</h2>
<div class="text3">
    In 1932, Ransome-Kuti had helped establish the Abeokuta Ladies Club.[2] The club focused on charity work, sewing, catering and adult 
    education classes,[3] and its early members were mostly Christian, Western-educated women[2] from the middle class. By the 1940s, 
    however, the club was moving in a more political direction. Inspired by an illiterate friend who asked her for help learning how to read, 
    Ransome-Kuti began organizing literacy workshops for market women through the club, and she subsequently gained a greater understanding of 
    social and political inequalities faced by many Nigerian women.[5] Writing about the freedoms granted by her own more privileged background, Ransome-Kuti noted that "the true position of Nigerian women had to be judged from the women who carried babies on their backs and farmed from sunrise to sunset … not women who used tea, sugar, and flour for breakfast".[6]:174 In 1944 she developed a successful campaign to stop local authorities seizing rice from market women under false pretenses.[7]
    In 1946 the club was formally renamed the Abeokuta Women's Union (AWU), now open to all women in Abeokuta. The organisation now turned its 
    focus to fighting unfair price controls and taxes imposed on market women, with Ransome-Kuti as the AWU's president.[2] She had founded the 
    nion along with Grace Eniola Soyinka[8] (her husband's niece and the mother of Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka),[9][1]:157 and the AWU gradually 
    grew to represent 20,000 official members, with up to 100,000 additional supporters.[10] In an effort to unify women and avoid class 
    conflict, Ransome-Kuti and other formally educated members spoke Yoruba and wore traditional Yoruba clothing to union meetings and events.
    [3]The Alake's palace in Abeokuta.
    Ransome-Kuti's first well-known political activity came when she led the AWU in a protest against a tax on women. 
    In Abeokuta, alongside regular taxes for income and water usage, market women were also forced to pay a special tax that went directly to 
    market supervisors or "parakoyis".[1]:78 The Alake Ademola II, a local traditional ruler of Abeokuta who now became part of the colonial 
    administration via indirect rule, had imposed taxes on women after the Egba Native Administration had been established in 1914. 
    After a failed appeal to British authorities to remove the current Alake from power and halt the tax, Ransome-Kuti and the AWU began 
    contacting newspapers and circulating petitions.[3] Aiming to put more pressure on authorities, AWU members publicly refused to pay their 
    taxes, staged long vigils outside the Alake's palace, and arranged an audit of the Sole Native Authority System (SNA) finance records. 
    Along with their objective of ending the tax on women, they demanded representation for women on the SNA's executive council.[5]
    By late 1947, Abeokuta authorities began forbidding women from organizing parades or demonstrations, denying them the necessary permits. 
    Undeterred, Ransome-Kuti and her fellow organisers declared that they were planning "picnics" and "festivals" instead, drawing up to 10,000 
    participants to their demonstrations – some of which involved altercations with police.[1]:81 Ransome-Kuti trained women in how to deal 
    with the tear gas canisters sometimes thrown at them, and the AWU used its membership dues to fund legal representation for arrested members.
    [1]:81 According to one story, when a British district officer shouted at Ransome-Kuti to shut her women up, she responded "You may have 
    been born, but you were not bred! Would you speak to your mother like that?"[1]:84 The West African Pilot described her as the "Lioness of 
    Lisabi".[1]:77 Tensions between AWU protesters and authorities came to a head in February 1948 when the Alake compared AWU women to 
    "vipers that could not be tamed" and banned Ransome-Kuti from entering the palace for political meetings. Immediately afterwards, 
    AWU members blocked the palace entrance and refused to let the visiting British district officer leave. The incident concluded with a 
    scuffle when Ransome-Kuti grabbed hold of the steering wheel of the district officer's car and refused to let go "until he pried her hand 
    loose".[1]:85 Public sympathy grew in support of the women. Throughout early 1948, AWU members continued to protest the tax, fighting with 
    petitions, press conferences, letters to newspapers, and demonstrations. After more demonstrations in late April of that year, the Alake 
    finally responded to the women's demands, suspending the tax on women and appointing a special committee to look into the AWU's complaints.
    [1]:86 In early 1949, the AWU's efforts led to the temporary abdication of the Alake.[3][11] Newspapers across Nigeria published stories 
    about the event, and Ransome-Kuti's work with the AWU became widely publicised.[5]

<h3 class="death">DEATH</h3>
<div class="text4">
In the later years of Ransome-Kuti's life, her son Fela, a musician and activist, became known for his vocal criticisms of Nigerian military 
governments. Fela had been arrested and briefly imprisoned during the early 1970s, and authorities had raided his home and properties several 
times. To show his disdain for the Federation of Nigeria's authority, he named his home property "the Kalakuta Republic"[1]:168 and transformed 
it into a commune where friends and supporters could gather and spend time without fear of the military authorities.[21] In November 1974, 
Nigerian police raided his nightclub in town with axes and tear gas, leaving Fela with injuries.[22] In 1976, Fela released an album called 
Zombie, in which he compared the army to mindless machines,[23] and many believe that this album acted as a final straw in the conflict between 
Fela and the government.[21][23]
Ransome-Kuti often visited her son at his compound, and she was there on 18 February 1977 when close to 1,000 armed soldiers 
surrounded and stormed the property. As soon as the soldiers broke inside they began destroying property and assaulting the residents. 
Fela and Bekolari were beaten and severely injured.[1]:168–169 Ransome-Kuti was thrown from a second-floor window.[2] Following the attack, 
she was hospitalised and eventually lapsed into a coma. She died on 13 April 1978 as a result of her injuries.[1]:169–170
Ransome-Kuti's remains were interred in Abeokuta in the same vault as her husband. Her funeral services were attended by thousands, 
and many market women and traders shut down shops and markets across the city to mark her death.[1]:171 Major Nigerian news outlets 
published eulogies, naming the activist "a progressive revolutionary" and "a Pan-African visionary".[1]:170
On the one-year anniversary of Ransome-Kuti's death,[1]:171 Fela took a coffin and travelled nearly 20 kilometres to Dodan Barracks 
in Lagos (then Nigeria's Supreme Military Headquarters), leaving the coffin at the gate in an attempt to shame the government.[22][23][24] 
The invasion, her death, and the movement of the coffin is detailed in his song "Coffin for Head of State".[25]
